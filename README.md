*DESCRIPTION*:
The E-Learning Platform UI is a front-end design project created to simulate a real-world online learning experience. The goal was to design an interactive, responsive, and user-friendly interface that mimics what students and educators would use on an actual e-learning website.

The platform is divided into multiple sections: a homepage, course listings, progress tracking, and a video viewing page. At the top, a clean navigation bar allows users to move smoothly between these pages. The homepage offers a warm welcome and a brief overview of the platform's purposeâ€”making education accessible and engaging.

The Courses page features styled cards for each subject, including HTML & CSS, JavaScript, and Python. Each card includes a course title, description, and a link to begin watching the course video. This leads to the video page, which embeds YouTube videos directly within the site, allowing students to learn without leaving the platform.

The Progress section is designed with HTML5 <progress> bars that visually show how far a user has come in each course. It's a simple but effective way to reflect user engagement and encourage goal-setting.

The development process focused on clean structure (HTML), attractive layouts (CSS), and responsiveness to ensure usability on different devices. Everything was built from scratch to give a realistic, professional feel.

This project showcases how a static front-end can effectively mimic real e-learning environments and lays the groundwork for future enhancements like authentication, quizzes, or backend integration.
